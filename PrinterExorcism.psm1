    .SYNOPSIS
        Launches the structured printer cleanup process.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function serves as the canonical entry point for launching the two-phase printer exorcism process.
        It delegates to Start-PrinterExorcismSession, passing through cleanup options such as GPO comparison,
        automation mode, and verbosity level.

        If TargetUser is specified, cleanup is performed against that user's registry hive.
        Otherwise, the currently logged-in user's profile is used.

    .PARAMETER FullCleanup
        Performs a full printer cleanup, including registry entries and WMI-printer mappings.

    .PARAMETER CompareGPO
        Only remove printers not defined in GPO-deployed connections. Skips all others.

    .PARAMETER Automated
        Suppresses prompts and assumes consent for all actions.

    .PARAMETER TargetUser
        The username whose hive should be loaded and cleaned. If omitted, defaults to current user.

    .PARAMETER Verbosity
        Sets the logging level for console and file output. Options are: Info, Warning, Critical, Debug.

    .EXAMPLE
        Invoke-PrinterExorcism -FullCleanup -Automated -Verbosity Debug

        Performs a full cleanup for the current user without prompts, logging at maximum verbosity.

        truly want to make the printers suffer ‚Äî and want everyone to know it.

function Show-PrinterDiscovery {

    .SYNOPSIS
        Displays a list of printers and printer-related registry entries for a specific user.

        This function wraps the standalone Discover-Printers.ps1 script for use within the module.
        If -JSON is set, it emits structured JSON output suitable for logging or pipelines.

function Start-SystemWidePrinterCleanup {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Performs a full printer cleanup across all user profiles on the system.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function iterates through each user profile in C:\Users, loading each user's registry hive 
        (if available), and performs a comprehensive printer cleanup using PrinterExorcist.ps1. 
        Built-in printers are preserved. Cleanup includes registry entries, WMI printer objects, 
        and ghost printers.

        After per-user cleanup, system-level (HKLM and spooler) printers are also purged, 
        except for Microsoft built-in printers.

        Must be run as Administrator. This is equivalent to `-SystemWide` mode.
